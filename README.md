# iPhoneSE_TeardownTemplate
Teardown Template for the iPhone SE. I couldn't find a good one online, so I made this. Print on A3 Paper. For the battery, make a 1:1 replica using foam and the provided PDF. Note that cyanoacrylate (super glue, krazy glue, etc) undergoes a highly exothermic reaction with foam, so adjust adhesive use accordingly (ie. use hot glue). See this chart for more info on adhesives: https://d-lab.mit.edu/resources/publications/d-lab-learn-it-adhesives.
